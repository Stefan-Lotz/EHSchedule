              Hey! This is Stefan, creator of EHSchedule. This
              page just explains some information about the creation of this
              website. Feel free to read about some of the things I found
              interesting while building this schedule site!
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-12 aboutText">
            <p>
              This was created as a project to see how I could combine
              Javascript and HTML, two coding languages I learned through the
              Computer Science magnet at Edgewater Highschool. I noticed that
              the class schedule posted on Edgewater's official website was not
              accurate to reflect changes made before the 2023-2024 school year
              started. I then started thinking about what might be useful to see
              on a small webpage made specifically for Edgewater's schedule. I
              threw it all together in a few days and now I have a super handy
              website to use when I want to know how much time is left in class!
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-12 aboutText">
            <p>
              The base function of this website may be complete, but I still
              want to improve it in any way I can. Since I graduated in 2025, 
              I'm leaving that task up to the current students at Edgewater! 
              If you want to suggest a change or make a change, you can go to 
              the website's <a href="https://github.com/Stefan-Lotz/EHSchedule">GitHub Repository</a> 
              to do so. The future of EHSchedule now relies on you guys! Check 
              out the GitHub repository if you get a moment -- it's pretty cool.

            <ul class="changenotes">
              <li>
                EHSchedule has moved! I found what should be a permanent fix to 
                the hosting issue: GitHub Pages! Not blocked by the school, free 
                to use, and the URL isn't half bad. This is likely the end of the 
                road for this little project of mine. Soon after I graduate, the 
                original website will go down, along with the suggestion form. 
                This is kinda a bittersweet moment for me. It's been fun working 
                on this project for you all!

              <br>
              <li>
                Effective immediately, EHSchedule has migrated from 
                edgewaterschedule.codehs.me to stefan-lotz.github.io/EHSchedule

              <br>
              <li>
                If the bell schedule changes next year, anyone has the ability 
                to make changes to the source code by making a pull request on 
                <a href="https://github.com/Stefan-Lotz/EHSchedule">EHSchedule's 
                  GitHub page.</a> Make a fix and your code could help contribute 
                to this very website!

                Another suggestion change. On each schedule page, there's now a 
                countdown to the last day of school! This is counting down to the
                underclassmen's final day. Sorry seniors. You'll have to count 
                down to your graduation on your own.

                Speaking of graduation, it's sneaking up on me <i>very</i> fast!
                I was planning to try to figure out how to preserve this website 
                before I graduated, but I might have run out of time. I will try
                to find a way to keep this website up in some way, but unfortunately
                I can't make any promises.

                I know that in the previous changelog I said this website will no
                longer be maintained, but I figured I'd do one last update -- for 
                old time's sake, y'know? I've gotten a few suggestions to make the
                website show when we're in 10/10 (I think it's called "No Fly 
                Zone" or something now) so I decided to finally code that feature!

                New year, new site! Over the summer I have worked to create a 
                brand new website with more features and flexibility. As of 
                August 12, it is blocked by OCPS because it is a newly registered
                domain. However, once it is unblocked, all creative process and 
                attention will be shifted to my new site. This page will stay up 
                for the forseeable future, but it will no longer be updated.
